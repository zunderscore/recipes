## Submitting Your Own

If you go to the [Issues](https://github.com/zunderscore/recipes/issues) tab above, you can submit your own recipe to the community cookbook by creating a new issue with the **Recipe Submission** issue template.

If you later find that you need to amend a recipe, you can create a new issue using the **Update Recipe** issue template.
